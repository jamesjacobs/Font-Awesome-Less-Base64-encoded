Font Awesome (LESS) Base64 encoded
==================================

Base64 encoded version of Font awesome 3.2.1. Eliminate issues with serving fonts from a CDN (Firefox, I'm looking at you) when Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*" doesnt work.

Font files and original paths to font left in but commented out incase you need them.
